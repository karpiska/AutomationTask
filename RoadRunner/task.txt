Hi,
I see you decided to give it a try.
in case of any ambiguousness, go with your gut and use imagination.
Code was tested on Python 3.11

1. Fix two small issues with the code so the game starts properly and doesn't crash

2. Change the car shape to a rectangle.

3. Add an option to pause/unpause the game by pressing the key "P"

4. Currently, when turtle hits the wall, the next level starts immediately.
Add a congratulation message and a 3-second displayed countdown before the next level starts.

5. Add logging to game.log file. It should include relevant player input and game status.
Game.log contains all games played in the same day.

6. Add player input of the player name. Once the player dies, a results.txt will be updated with the player results.
If the player is already there, update the record only if he scored more. If there are other players, order the results
by the amount of points they earned.

Good luck!
